Sting is an experimental editor that tracks changes to the abstract syntax tree of the program you're editing. It combines ideas from [Variolite](https://marybethkery.com/projects/Verdant/variolite-supporting-exploratory-programming.pdf), [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/), and [Pijul](https://pijul.org/). Currently, the tool is only written to support a pure subset of Python, but the long term goal is to support a variety of other pure languages.
