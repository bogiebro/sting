Sting is an experimental editor that tracks changes to the abstract syntax tree of the program you're editing. Specifically, changes are tracked as far down the tree as possible. Instead of presenting a single monolithic history for your entire program, as is common in traditional version control systems, Sting allows users to explore the history of each term in their AST independently. It aims to combine ideas from [Variolite](https://marybethkery.com/projects/Verdant/variolite-supporting-exploratory-programming.pdf), [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/), [REPLugger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8p5bj01UWk) and [Pijul](https://pijul.org/). Currently, the tool is only written to support a pure subset of Python, but the long term goal is to support a variety of other pure languages.
